          <p class="pb-12 text-base text-w-100">
            At Neurolinx, we leverage advanced artificial intelligence and
            machine learning algorithms to deliver personalized recommendations
            and search results across various industries. Our technology works
            by analyzing vast amounts of data, including user interactions,
            reviews, and product descriptions.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pb-4 text-2xl font-medium text-w-500">Source Data</h3>
          <p class="text-base text-w-100">
            We source our data from trusted suppliers and categorize it into
            three main categories:
          </p>
          <div class="pl-5 mb-6">

              <li class="text-base text-w-100">
                Internal Data: This category includes first-party data like
                engagement metrics, additional text data, and other user
                interaction data.

            The essence of our engineering process lies in keeping things simple
            for you. Neurolinx's prompt engineering process utilizes advanced

            The Simple Steps Needed
          </h3>
          <p class="pb-6 text-base text-w-100">
            We have pre-collected data from three industries: Beauty &
            Cosmetics, Movies & TV, and Travel. If your business is included in
            any of these three categories, the process should take approximately
            one month. If your business falls outside of these industries, the
            entire process should take around three months to complete.
          </p>

              Transmit Your Item Library:
              <span class="inline-block md:block"></span>
              Share information about your business goals and item library data
              with us. You can transmit the data through your preferred channel
              (we're flexible). Past methods of communication used by our
              clients include cloud storage software, messenger services, and
              email.

            <li class="pb-6 text-base text-w-100">
              Data Preprocessing: <span class="inline-block md:block"></span>
              We will begin by mapping your item data with user language data.
              If your site includes real user reviews of items, please provide
              us with your review data to enhance the relevance of your Data
              Science and Customer Management (DSCM) system. Rest assured, the
              review data you share will only be used to improve the relevancy
              of your DSCM system and will not be shared with any other parties
              or used for other projects.

              Model Training: <span class="inline-block md:block"></span>
              We will initiate the basic training and customization of the
              Neurolinx ML model. During this stage, we will conduct A/B tests
              of various algorithms and filtering techniques to identify the
              most suitable ones for your business objectives. Once we have
              determined the optimal methods, we will calculate and refine the
              semantics to be used as new search and recommendation signals. The
              duration of this step will vary depending on factors such as the
              size of your item library and your desired business goals.

              Transfer Results: <span class="inline-block md:block"></span>
              Once the Neurolinx model is deployed, we will transmit the results
              using an API.

              Check Results: <span class="inline-block md:block"></span>
              If you encounter any counterintuitive or seemingly implausible
              results while reviewing your received data, don't worry. This can
              happen because AI understands everything through numbers and
              scores, while humans achieve understanding on a more collective
              basis. To address this, you can access our Solution Admin page to
              make any necessary adjustments to the AI-generated results. Click
